This is where all essential information about the code is stored.

KNN


What is it?

KNN or K-nearest neighbor is a simple machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. "K" represents the number of neighbors
to consider when making a prediction, the code used in the zip file is a classification algorithm.

What can it do?

The dataset is used to put cars into different categories based off their attributes such as price, storage size, and its number of doors. This 
data can be used to classify different types of cars or possibly recommed a certain type of car to a customer looking to buy one.

What does it do to work?

The model imports libraries, prepares data/labels, makes predictions regarding the data and then prints the data.


Linear Regression


What is it?

Linear regression is used to express the relationship between a dependent and independent variable, it exels in making neural networks.
The code uses multiple inputs such as G1, G2, studytime, and failures to ultimatley predict the output variable which is G3.

What can it do?

The data in this senario is mainly used to predict a students grades, its unlikely it would ever be used in a real setting however, as 
it is an ai model so it is prone to having some failures.

What does it do to work?

The model imports libraries, reads the data on the student-mat.csv file, gets columns to train itself with e.g. G1 and G2, uses a sklearn linear regression model
to train itself, prints the coefficients and intercepts, and finally vizualises the data using a scatterplot. (SCREENSHOT OF SCATTERPLOT BELOW)
